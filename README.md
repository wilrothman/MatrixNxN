# Unfinished project

I still need to clean this whole thing up and, of course, add matrix multiplication, dot-products, vector support, etc. 
I plan to use the Volker Strassen matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm to implement square matrix multiplication in $O(n^{2.81})$ time instead of $O(n^3)$ time.
